  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the EUSART1 driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs

  @Description
    This source file provides APIs for EUSART1.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.65
        Device            :  PIC16F15324
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 1.45
        MPLAB 	          :  MPLAB X 4.10
